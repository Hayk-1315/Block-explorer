# 🔍 Block-Explorer

**Block-Explorer** is a lightweight Ethereum block explorer built with **React** and the **Alchemy SDK**.  
It allows you to browse the Ethereum blockchain — view blocks, transactions, address balances, and even NFT metadata — all in one simple interface.

## ✨ Features
✅ Browse the most recent Ethereum blocks  
✅ View transactions in each block  
✅ Explore transaction details by hash  
✅ Check account balances and transaction history  
✅ Fetch NFT metadata for any address  
✅ Built with React and powered by the Alchemy SDK
